# JavaScript-Starbucks-Interface
This project showcases a user interface modeled after Starbucks Korea's website.
Unlike the original website, which utilizes jQuery, this project intentionally avoids the use of libraries such as jQuery, Lodash, Swiper, Scroll Magic, and GSAP. 
The primary objective is to delve into the fundamental workings of the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), offering a hands-on experience in understanding these core web technologies.
