# JavaScript-Starbucks-Interface
This project displays a user interface modeled after Starbucks Korea's website.
Unlike the original website, which utilizes jQuery, this project intentionally avoids the use of libraries such as jQuery, Lodash, Swiper, Scroll Magic, and GSAP. 
The primary objective of this project is to delve into the fundamental workings of DOM(Document Object Model) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets).
